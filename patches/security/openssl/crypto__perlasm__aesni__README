+This contains a backported version of the perl routines from OpenSSL 
+1.0.0. The AES-NI support on i386 requires features (like 4-argument 
+support) which were not present in 0.9.8.
+
+We don't just overwrite the versions in the parent directory, 
+although we could do so, because we're trying to keep the AES-NI support 
+patch as unintrusive as possible.
